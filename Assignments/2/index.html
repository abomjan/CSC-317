        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Adarsha Bomjan. I am a junior level student at <strong>San Francisco State University</strong> , majoring in <strong>BS in Computer Science</strong>. I am passionate about Software Development, also in Web Development, and I enjoy applying what I learn in class to real world projects.</p>
        <p>Outside academics, I am into videography, and photography. I like watching soccer(football), and Formula 1. My favorite soccer team is <em>Real Madrid</em> , and in Formula 1, I support <em>McLaren Racing Team</em> . All my interest outside academics helps me in creative abilities. I try to implement these things in my projects and school which helps me a lot.</p>
        <p>I am excited to continue building my experience in Computer Science and exploring every opportunity that comes in my way.</p>
